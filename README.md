# jianpu-ly

Jianpu in Lilypond, from http://ssb22.user.srcf.net/mwrhome/jianpu-ly.html

(also mirrored at http://ssb22.gitlab.io/mwrhome/jianpu-ly.html just in case, and available via `pip install jianpu-ly` or `pipx run jianpu-ly`)

jianpu-ly is a Python program (compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3) that assists with printing jianpu (numbered musical notation) in the GNU Lilypond music typesetter. The jianpu is written on a modiﬁed-appearance “stave” in Lilypond, which means Lilypond’s typesetting capabilities (lyric spacing, slurs, beams etc) will apply to the jianpu without needing to add a 5-line stave. If you prefer, the generated code for the jianpu stave may also be placed in a score with other types of stave.

Using jianpu-ly requires some technical knowledge.  If you don't know what a command line is, what a text editor is, what a directory is or what Python is, then please find out about these things before attempting to use jianpu-ly.  It is not an extension to Lilypond front-ends like Frescobaldi; it is a preprocessor that currently requires you to have command-line experience.

If you have problems, try a different Lilypond version.
jianpu-ly works with Lilypond 2.18, 2.20, 2.22 and 2.24.
